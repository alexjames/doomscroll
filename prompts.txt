# Initial Setup
Create a React App flash cards quiz app. On the main page, you can see one flash card at a time.
If you click on a card, it rotates to show the answer in the back. You have to scroll up to see the next card, similar to Tiktok.
There are two modes - (1) Learn Mode and (2) Practice Mode. In Learn Mode, show all the cards one by one. In practice mode.
In practice mode, the app keeps track of how many answers you got correct and wrong.
Data to display in the cards is queried from a Python backend that stores all the quiz data.
Implement this frontend and backed.
