Ingress Options
Directly Hit VM
* No network hop
* minimal infrastructure + cost
* can't easily scale
* single point of failure
* traffic spikes can overwhelm instance
* logging, rate-limiting and TLS termination needs to be built into the VM
* Best suited for low traffic and non-critical apps.

Add a loadbalancer
A load balancer spreads requests across attached instances
* Can have high availability if one instance fails.
* Can scalre by adding and removing instances
* Health checks can remove unhealthy instances
* TLS termination converts HTTPs traffic to HTTP, offloading CPU intensive crypto from the backend servers & cnetralizes certificate management
* auth and rate-limiting still need to be implemented by the VM
* needs configuration management and tuning
* Best suited for apps that need scalability and availability, works for both monoliths and simple micro-services.

Hit an API Gateway
specialized entry point that manages APU requests before routing them to the backend
* centralized API management
* performs authn & authz (e.g. OAuth, JWT, API keys)
* rate-limiting and throttling
* request / responst validation
* routes requests - path-based validation, header-based or API version-based
* observability through logging, metrics and tracing
* adds a network hop and latency
* adds operational overhead & expense
* needs to tbe scaled horizontally & typically requires a multi-AZ deployment
* Best suited for large microservices ecosystems, heterogeneous consumers (web, mobile, partners) and environments requirisng strong governance and security
